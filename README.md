<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is part of the code for my Master thesis project, where I will investigate the influence of vegetation movement (e.g., leaves shaking) during
high-resolution laser scanning acquisition on the resulting point clouds and the information derived from it.

In a first step, I am creating synthetic animated trees with leaves which undergo rigid motions. The add-on [movingleaves.py](https://github.com/han16nah/movingtree_b2h/blob/main/addons/moveleaves.py)
is a first prototype to do so. As a basis, it requires a tree object, as generated by the Add-on [Sapling Tree Gen](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/add_curve/sapling.html) with the
tree trunk converted to mesh and the leaves separated "By Loose Parts". See [Sapling_Tree_Gen_notes.md](https://github.com/han16nah/movingtree_b2h/blob/main/Sapling_Tree_Gen_notes.md) for more info.

Next, the tree animation is exported to a HELIOS++ scene. A first prototype is implemented with the Add-on [movingtree2helios](https://github.com/han16nah/movingtree_b2h/tree/main/addons/movingtree2helios).
Each OBJ file is exported and a scene file is written which includes the rigid motion sequences for each moving leaf.
